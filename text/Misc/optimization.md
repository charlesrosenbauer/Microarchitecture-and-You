# Guidelines on Optimization

---

**Introduction**

A lot of these articles are here to inform you on how to better utilize your hardware. This is, in essence, a form of software optimization.

Optimization of software is becoming a bit of a lost art these days, with most developers caring to optimize their code only after they have hit a wall and optimization becomes *absolutely necessary*. It still remains common in HPC, Embedded systems, and Game development, but general software isn't being optimized as well as it could be.

Sure, hardware keeps getting faster (for now), and software developers keep wanting easier and easier to use languages and tools. Plus we can always resort to the "let's just let the guys working on lower levels solve it", pushing work toward API developers, driver developers, compiler developers, hardware developers, and so on. However, rather than force other people to pick up our slack (as this will only take us so far), it might not hurt to, at least occasionally, ask ourselves "Is there a more efficient way to do this?", even if performance isn't absolutely critical.
