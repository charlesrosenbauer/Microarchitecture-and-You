# Why You Should Care About Memory

___

So, as a programmer, why should I care about how I'm using memory?

Because your computer's memory isn't as powerful as you think it is. Sure, you might have a few dozen GB of RAM, and that RAM might be running at a couple GHz. But there's more to consider than that. What about RAM latency? What about cache misses? What about cache prefetching? These might not sound like a big deal, or might sound like something that the hardware guys have probably taken care of for you, but it's actually more relavant than you might realize.

For example, how much does a cache miss cost you? Sure, a basic understanding of caches might give you the impression that it's bad, but the cache is supposed to take care of everything for you, right? Right?

Speaking of that, how does the cache even do that anyway? How does the cache work? How does it make sure it has what you need? How does it fit that into just a few megabytes?
