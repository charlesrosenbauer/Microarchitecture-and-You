# Why You Should Care About Memory

___

So, as a programmer, why should I care about how I'm using memory?

Because your computer's memory isn't as powerful as you think it is. Sure, you might have a few dozen GB of RAM, and that RAM might be running at a couple GHz. But there's more to consider than that. What about RAM latency? What about cache misses? What about cache prefetching? What about bandwidth? These might not sound like a big deal, or might sound like something that the hardware guys have probably taken care of for you, but it's actually more relavant than you might realize.

[How much does a cache miss cost you?](caches.md) Sure, a basic understanding of caches might give you the impression that it's bad, but just how bad? And how do caches work anyway?
