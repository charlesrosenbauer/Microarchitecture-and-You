**What Problems Does Virtual Memory Solving?**

Virtual memory solves a few different problems:
  * It hides fragementation of memory from programs
  * It adds an additional layer of separation between programs, which is useful for security

It also solved some problems in the past that are no longer necessary, mainly that it allowed multiple applications to share an address space larger than what any individual application could address. This was important in many 32-bit machines, though it unnecessary in 64-bit machines at the moment.
